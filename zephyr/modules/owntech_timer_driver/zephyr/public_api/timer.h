 *
 * @brief  This file is the public include file for the
 *         Zephyr Timer driver. It provides basic functionnality
 *         to handle STM32 Timers. Is is for now specific
 *         to certain capabilities of G4 series Timers,
 *         and mainly restricted to the use we do of
 *         the timers in the OwnTech project, but it aims
 *         at becoming more generic over time.
 *
 *         This version suports:
 *         * Timer 6 and Timer 7: Periodic call of a callback function with period ranging from 2 to 6553 µs.
 *         * Timer 4: Incremental coder acquisition with pinout: reset=PB3; CH1=PB6; CH2=PB7.
